# Bartog / Bartok / Warthog / etc.

This game of many names is a game that attracts game designer types but few others. Implementing it in software is also an attractive challenge. Two reasons then to implement a single player version of it!

# Rules references

Bartog, as I will refer to it, appears to have started at a university somewhere, potentially in Australia, and spread primarily through word of mouth/the Internet. As such there are a few different available versions of the rules some of which are subtly different, and since making up extra rules is part of the game, these rulesets also often include suggested rules. In order to <del>cobble together a set of rules which make implementation easier</del> try and capture the variations that have arisen, I've collected some of those rulesets here. This also gives me a nice set of example rules to try and make work in the implementation. Not all of the rules will be reasonable to implement, (or even very fun against a computer) so I am making no promise to implement them all. The more interesting thing to me is creating a space of rules such that the computer opponents can choose rules which have some novelty to them, and that different games have different "feels" from one another.

Because a worrying amount of pages on Bartog are dead links, I will preserve some of the pages here in this repo.
