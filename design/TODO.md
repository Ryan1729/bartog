## TODO

allow making a set of cards act as a particular card.
    we'd like to be able to say things like 8s count as 4s and have the 8 of spades count as a 4 of spades and the 8 of hearts count as a 4 of hearts and so on, but I'm not sure of a good interface for that.

in in_game::Change selection screen if there are no changes made to the rules make the done button a cancel button.

When b button is pressed on the menus, jump to "cancel".
