Bartog Rules - by Malcolm Ryan (malcolmr@cse.unsw.edu.au)
------------

INITIAL:
--------
1) Players each begin with 5 cards
2) The remaining cards are placed face down in the centre, forming "the pack". 
   The dealer then turns over the top card from the pack, this card
   has no effect on play. If a joker is turned up, then the dealer
   may turn over another card, and so forth.
   The first player is the first one to place an eligible card after 
   the card is turned over.
3) Play proceeds clockwise, unless any other rule states otherwise.
4) When it is a certain players turn, e may either play an eligible card
   from eir hand onto the face up pile (hereafter "the pile"), or pick up 
   a card from the pack (not both). 
   This play must be made within a reasonable time of it becoming eir turn 
   (as judged by the other players.)
5) Unless other rules state otherwise, an eligible card to play must be
   of the same suit or the same value as the card on the top of the face
   up pile.
6) A joker is a wild card, and so may be played as any other eligible card.
   The player playing the joker must announce which card it represents. 
7) When any player's hand changes from containing two or more cards to only 
   one card, e must say "Bartog".
8) Players may not ask questions during play.
9) Players may not make (provably) false statements during play.
10) If any player is deemed (by general consensus) to have broken any rule 
    the e must draw a card from the pack. Such a draw does NOT constitute 
    a player's turn. 
    This penalty may only be incurred if the breaking of the rule is 
    announced within a reasonable time after the event.
11) The winner of a round is the first player to have zero cards in eir
    hand. Generally, a player is deemed to have won BEFORE the final card
    played takes effect. 
12) A round ends when the winner is decided. The winner shall then invent 
    a new rule which will come into effect in the next round. New rules
    may repeal or override older rules. New rules must not be obviously 
    biased towards or against any player. New rules may not directly effect
    the creation or content of later rules. Other players may express their
    dissatisfaction with any new rule, but so long as the rule meets the 
    previous guidelines, the winner's word is final.
13) The winner then becomes the dealer for the next round. If e so desires
    e may declare any other player to be dealer instead of em.
14) During a round, timeout may be called by the players in order to 
    clarify some aspect of a new rule which was not previously clear. During
    this time questions may be asked of the player who created rule in 
    question, without penalty. In all such cases, the word of the rule's
    creator is final. If two or more rules conflict or combine with unclear
    effect, the player who created the most recent of those rules may decide
    the effect. Questions off the topic of rules clarification are not
    allowed during timeout. Trivial questions, or questions which have 
    already been clearly answered (to a majority of players) should not be 
    tolerated.
15) If any player enters the game and is unfamiliar with the rules in effect
    at the time, the other players ought not explain any more than the very
    general basics of the original rules. If ever the new player receives a
    penalty for some reason, then a brief (and not necessarily clear) reason
    for the penalty ought to be given. New players should be encouraged to
    work out the current rules by their own ingenuity.

SUGGESTED NEW RULES
-------------------

In any of the following, the following notation is used:

"card(n)", where n is a number from 2 to 13
        - Any of a set of about n cards, by value, regardless of suit. 
          Good choices of sets of cards are: 
          primes (not including 1), squares, cubes, odds, evens, 
          multiples of x, court cards, or particular suits or colors.
          In all such cases Jack, Queen, King are usually considered
          to have values 11, 12 and 13 respectively. Ace has value 1.
"card(1)"
        - Any single card, by value, regardless of suit. (Generally a card
          with does not already have a rule attached, altho overlap is 
          allowed, even encouraged, on occasion).
"card(1c)" (or "card(1s)")
        - Any single card by value and by colour (or by suit). This is
          generally recommended for rules which are considered to have
          "dangerous" effect, and for which it is desirable to have apply
          only rarely.

These values are offered as guidelines only, and any rule may be applied to
more or fewer cards than suggested, at the creator's discretion.

After each rule's name, a guage of difficulty/nastiness is given: 
* = beginner rule
** = advanced beginner
*** = experienced
**** = experienced difficult
***** = masochists only

Note: This does not imply that beginner or advanced beginner rules are not fun 
for expert players.

1) SKIP X *

        On card(3), play skips X (= 1,2...) people. 

2) REVERSE *

        On card(3-6), the direction of play changes.

3) SWAP (LOCAL) **

        On card(1-3), the current player swaps hands with a certain player.
        (On eir left/right/opposite/in dirn of play/by choice etc.)

4) SWAP (GLOBAL) **

        On card(1-2), all players give their hands to another certain player.
        (On eir left/right/opposite/in dirn of play etc.)

5) SNAP **

        (When more than one pack is being used.)
        If a player has a card in eir hand, identical (same number AND suit)
        to the card on the top of the pile then e may immediately play that 
        card (regardless of whether it is eir turn or not), saying "SNAP" 
        when doing so, and play continues as if it had been that player's 
        turn.
        When only one pack is being used, a card of the same number and 
        colour may be snapped instead.

5a) CRACKLE **

	(When rule 5 is in use)
	If a card has just been snapped, as per rule 5, and  a player has a
	card in eir hand of the same suit and number _one_more_ than the
	snapped card, e may play it immediately (regardless of turn) and 
	say "CRACKLE" when doing so. Play continues from em.

6) DRAW X (cumulative) **

        On card(1), then next player has to pick up X cards. This
        constitutes that players turn.
        If the rule is declared to be cumulative then the next player may
        play another (legal) draw card as eir turn, an the next player has
        to draw 2X, and so forth, until some player cannot play.

6a) BUCK STOPS HERE **

        If a draw rule (6) is in effect, a card(1) may be played (if eligible)
        as a "stop" card, instead on drawing. When this card is played, the
        last player to have played a draw card has to draw (unavoidably).

7) CHANGING PLACES *

        On card(1) player changes position with a certain other player.
        (as per swapping) Players may have to take their hands with them,
        or leave them behind.

8) REVERSE #2 **

        Play goes cw after a red card and ccw after a black card.

9) TOURNAMENT RULES ***

        The winner of a round is dealt on fewer cards in future rounds.
        If ever a player is to be dealt zero cards, then e is declared the
        winner of the tournament, and the tournament ends. 

9a) ANTI-TOURNAMENT RULES ***

        Player with most cards at the end of round gets an extra card in
        future rounds. (Difficult to stop players from throwing in their 
        hands)

10) RESET CARD ****

        On card(1s) the rules are reset to the initial set, or some reduced
        set, for the duration of the round (or even permanently). For use in
        _very_ long games only.

11) DANGER CARD ***

        On card(1c) the player has to draw 2-3 cards from the pack.

12) LAST CARD HAS EFFECT ***

        The effect of the last card to be played is counted _before_ 
        determining the winner.

13) DOUBLE HANDS ***

        All players are dealt two hands called "top" and "bottom".
        Players may only ever look at their current "top" hand.
        On card(1) all players swap their top and bottom hands.
        The winner is now the first player to have zero cards in
        eir TOP hand.

13a) BOTTOM HAND SWAP **

        Assorted swap rules (global/local) may be applied to players'
        bottom hands, top hands, or both.

14) BEEP/QUACK *

        On card(1-6) player must say "BEEP" or "QUACK" etc...
        (Multiples of these rules can be fun)

15) ON YER BIKE *

        On card(1) player must run to a certain landmark and back.
        If it becomes eir turn again and e is not back yet, e can be
        given a card for taking too long.

16) TABOO ***

        Certain words, eg "Yes","No","I", may not be spoken.

17) THREE WORD RULE ***

        On card(1) player may only speak in sets of three words at a time
        (no more, no fewer) with reasonable pauses in between, until 
        such time as another player players that card.

18) UNDER THE INFLUENCE ****

        On card(1) player is "under the influence" and may only speak in 
        false-hoods. The player is exempt from any penalties for saying
        false statements, but can be penalised for saying (provably) true
        statements.
        A player stays "under the influence" until another player plays
        that card.

19) STICKY HANDS/PLACES ***

        The effect of rules such as 17 and 18 may be transferred when the
        player swaps hands or places with another player.

20) SNAP TO WIN ***

        If a player can snap on the (otherwise) winning card, then e is
        the winner instead. If three or more packs are used, then the last
        player to snap (before throwing in their hand) wins.

21) PARALLEL GAMES ****

        If numbers permit, two or more separate games may be run, each with
        its own set of players and rules. Each game acts as per usual for
        a single game, with one extra rule: On card(1c) player must swap
        places with a player of choice, in another game.

22) NAME THAT TUNE *

        On card(1-2) player must name a movie/song/commercial etc which
        has not yet been mentioned.

23) REVALUATION ***

        Card(1) henceforth is considered to be have some other value
        with respect to eligibility, effect and future play.

23a) MASS REVALUATION *****

        All cards henceforth have value one more than their face.
        (Very Nasty, esp. with many rules in place!)

24) DOUBLE PLAY **

        On card(1) the current player has another turn.

25) BILL (Ghost hand) ****

        An extra hand is dealt, face up, to a ghost player called "Bill", 
        who sits opposite the winner of the previous round, who is to be 
        Bill's "caller". Bill has turns like any other player, but Bill's 
        plays are decided by the caller.
        If Bill has only one card left, then he automatically draws 
        another card (for failing to say Bartog), but the caller must
        make sure that Bill follows all the other rules (including Beeps,
        Quacks, et al.). If Bill breaks a rule, then the caller has to draw
        the penalty card.

26) NAME OF THE GAME *

	Change the name of the game (and hence, what players must say when
	they have only one card in their hand) to something other than
	"Bartog". Can cause much confusion (and fun) when played by
	experienced players. Suggested names are "Vickie makes up silly rules"
	and "Snap!".

27) WRONG HAND ONLY *

	Players must play cards using their non-writing hand.

28) TAKE THAT *

	When card(1) is played, the next player in dirn of play must pick up
	that card.

29) RUMMY RULES *

       (i) If a player has several cards of the face value in their 
           hand, and one of them is normally playable, then they may all
	   be played at once. The first such card to be played must be 
	   normally playable. Only the last card has effect.

      (ii) If a player has a run of successive cards from a particular
           suit in their hand, the lowest of which is playable, then
	   they may all be played at once, in order from lowest to 
           highest. Only the highest card takes effect.

        These two rules are useful for getting rid of cards quickly in
        games with lots of pickups.
