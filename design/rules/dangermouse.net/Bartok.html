<h1>Bartok</h1>

<em>Bartok</em> is a fun, fast-paced card game. It's also very easy to learn and has probably the fewest rules of any card
game in existence.
<p>
Get a standard pack of cards (remove jokers) and some rowdy friends, because here are the rules:

</p><ol>
<li>Choose a dealer. After each hand, the player on the dealer's left should become the new dealer. The deal is 7 cards
each, with one card placed face up in the centre to start the discard pile, and the remainder face down as a draw pile.
</li><li>If a player breaks any rule, either purposefully or accidentally, and the breach is noted by other players, that
player must immediately draw a penalty card.
</li><li>Players may not ask questions while the game is in progress.
</li><li>Players may not address or refer to any other player by name while the game is in progress.
</li><li>Players take turns in clockwise sequence. During a player's turn, they must either discard a card from their hand
which matches the suit or number of the card on top of the discard pile, or if they cannot do so, draw a card.
</li><li>Whenever the number of cards in a player's hand reaches one, they must say "Bartok".
</li><li>The first player to rid their hand of cards wins the hand. The winner of the hand must invent one new rule before
the start of the next hand.
</li></ol>

That's it! Simple, huh?
<p>
Oh, what's that? "What sort of new rules can you invent?"
</p><p>
I'm glad you asked... Here are some samples:

</p><ul>
<li>Whenever an ace is played, the person playing it may declare it to be any suit.
</li><li>When a 7 is played, the direction of play is reversed (clockwise becomes anticlockwise, and vice versa).
</li><li>Whenever the number of cards in a player's hand reaches two, they must say "Bartok minus one". Note that this
includes when a player goes up to two cards because of a penalty card drawn for not saying "Bartok".
</li><li>When a 2 is played, the next player must forfeit their turn and draw two cards instead.
</li><li>When a black 6 is played, the player two positions to the right of the current player must miss their next turn.
</li><li>Red queens shall be considered 5s for all purposes, black 5s shall be considered queens for all purposes.
</li><li>Any player who plays a jack must immediately quote a line from a Monty Python sketch. Lines previously quoted in
the same game do not count.
</li><li>When a red 9 is played, the person whose turn was two players before the current person's turn must moo loudly like a cow.
</li><li>When a card is played which causes the numerical value of the top two cards on the discard pile (counting jack=11,
queen=12, king=13) to sum to 14, the player who played the second last discard gets an extra turn between the
players who would otherwise have their turns next and next again.
</li><li>All clubs shall be considered as cards of their numerical value plus 5, modulo 13.
</li><li>When a black card of value 3 less than the previous discard is played, all cards which are currently clubs become
diamonds, and vice versa.
</li></ul>

Use your twisted imagination...
