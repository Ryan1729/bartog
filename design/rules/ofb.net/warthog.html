<title>BARTOK / Warthog-- self-modifying game</title>

<center><h1>Bartok / Warthog</h1></center>
The original name of the game is, as far as I know, Bartok.  But I 
heard about the game through the net, and when I finally convinced 
people to play this silly game with me, I couldn't quite remember 
the name and approximated it as "Warthog".  So the dozens of people 
who have learned this game directly or indirectly from me have 
learned it as Warthog.  I may have gotten the starting rules wrong 
as well, but with a self-modifying game, who cares?<p>

A set of Aussie rules exists, maintained by 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160312043224/http://www.ecr.mu.oz.au/~msk/">Matt King</a>.  The
main difference is that if you are wrong in giving somebody a penalty
you recieve a penalty yourself.  Otherwise the game is very similar.
</p><p>

</p><h2>Base Rules</h2>
New players should go through the ritual of playing the game for the first 
time with snide people who have played it previously, who can laugh at 
you when you break rules they haven't told you about, and hand you 
penalty cards for each infraction.  But if you don't know anybody who can 
fulfil that vital role and don't feel like making a trip to Waterloo and 
the Math Comfy Lounge to meet with me, then read 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160312043224/http://ofb.net/~lisa/wrules.html">this</a>.  
<p>
The only thing that you need to know to understand the rest of this document 
is that it is based on Crazy Eight's (take turns playing a card or picking 
one up, and follow suit or rank of the card previously played), and that 
every time a round is won by somebody playing all their cards, that person 
makes up a new rule and explains it.  Play begins again with that rule and 
all others made during that session/evening (If you really want to get cruel, 
start keeping rules from previous games!).</p><p>
There is no ultimate winner (unless you make a rule about that).  Play stops 
when you decide to stop.</p><p>

</p><h2>More Rules</h2>
Since the best part of the game is thinking up new rules, cool rules, I intend this page to be a resource for ideas on rules. <p> 
</p><h3>Personal Favourites</h3>
<ul>
<li>OEDIPUS JACK -- Any jack can be played on any queen, regardless of the suits.  A jack can never be played on a king.
</li><li>THANK-YOU -- Whenever a player is given a penalty card, they must say thank-you, including when the penalty card is for not saying thank-you.
</li><li>NO-NAMES -- You may not use the names of anybody playing the game.
Rather than call me 'Lisa' you would have to say "Hey you" or "the woman
in green".  Variation 1:  Assign a name to each player.  I once had
everyone choose a Lewis Carroll character name.  Variation 2:  First and
last names, of anybody present or not present, playing or not playing,
may not be used.
</li></ul>
<h3>Rule parts</h3>
<ul>
<li>CHANGE OF PENALTY -- Rules that require a different kind of penalty, such as more than one card, or performing a certain action, are fun.  Specify this when you specify the rule; otherwise the standard penalty is one card.  
</li></ul>
<h4>Triggers</h4>
Many different events can trigger a rule's effect, such as:
<ul>
<li>A card of a certain rank is played
</li><li>A card of a certain suit is played
</li><li>A particular card is played
</li><li>A player has X cards in their hand (make this trigger happen even when the player goes past the required number of cards, such as if they pick up 4 penalty cards which brings them past the "three cards in your hand" trigger, it takes effect)
</li><li>Something happens outside the game 
</li><li>The top three cards in the play pile are the same rank
</li><li>A prime/even/odd/red/black/face card is played
</li></ul>
<h3>Pure Fun</h3>
<ul>
<li>DANCE! -- Useful to get people to loosen up!  Choose a card that, when played, the player has to get up and dance for five seconds.
</li></ul>
<h3>Don't Do It...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can't use the word "card".
</li><li>Can't use any numbers.
</li><li>Can't use the first or last name of anybody in the room.
</li><li>Can't refer to any card by its rank or suit.
</li></ul>
<h3>Standard Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cause the next player(s) to skip a turn, or
</li><li>next player to pick up X cards
</li><li>reverse direction of play
</li><li>Say a word or a phrase when a trigger occurs
</li></ul>
<h3>Prop Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cause somebody to have to wear "the hat" or "a hat" (or any symbol)
</li><li>Cause the person/people wearing the hat to have extra restrictions or priviledges
</li></ul>
